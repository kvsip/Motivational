## Welcome to GitHub Pages
Motivate And Get Motivated Motivation is something essential in one's life. Motivation is the energy booster to make ourselves feel in a positive vibes. A day is full of hectic works and tensions but whenever you get motivated you're getting boosted up to reach your destination. Reaching the destination doesn't means attaining the level of achievement, it is beyond that.. Exploring the universe untill you find yourself in the enormous world is the true success. We all search of daily motivation but we don't know to motivate others. Here's the most inspirational motivation from the long lasting souls--- “If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.” – Albert Einstein Every child is an artist, the problem is staying an artist when you grow up.” – Pablo Picasso “Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.” – Søren Kierkegaard “Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire, you will what you imagine, and at last, you create what you will.” – George Bernard Shaw “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” – Gandhi “Life is made of ever so many partings welded together.” – Charles Dickens “The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.” – Lao Tzu
